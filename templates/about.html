<p>InstaClone is a sample web-app using Python/Flask, deployed on
Amazon EC-2.
</p>

<p>Please don't use this as an example of a desirable style of web
development - I know I have no models, no orm, poor separation of
concerns, paths hard coded in templates, etc! This is
a <em>trivial</em> web app, trivially written...
